Integrating AOP with Spring MVC CRUD App

This project demonstrates the integration of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) with a Spring MVC-based CRUD application to enhance modularity and maintainability. It leverages Spring MVC for handling web requests, Spring Data for persistence operations, and AOP for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, transaction management, performance monitoring, and exception handling without polluting the core business logic. By applying AOP concepts, the application cleanly separates concerns like request tracking, service-layer monitoring, and error tracing from the main CRUD functionalities, resulting in a more organized, testable, and extensible architecture.
